              <p>Hi! I am the developer of this website and the founder of GoCareering. I am 15 years old and a 10th grade student at Green Hills Academy. I started GoCareering for 
              my personal project assignment that I have been working on since grade 9. I got the idea when I was discussing with my father what I wanted to be in the future and I 
              hadn't made my decision yet and neither did I have much information about the variety of the careers. So, we got the idea of carrying out different interviews with 
              different career specialists and recording them so that we can also provide it to other highschool students who are in my situation. I started to contact the people I 
              knew and interviewed them and made my interviews public as planned. I really hope you gain as much information as possible and I wish you a happy careering!</p>
